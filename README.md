# Changes to Multicraft
- Added `CATEGORIES` for specific configurations.
- Purpose is to `RESTRICT` specific `CATEGORIES` so they cannot be `RELOADED` and will result in an `ERROR` to inform you a `FULL RESTART` is required.
- `CATERGORIES` that are not `RESTRICTED` can be `RELOAD` using `./bin/multicraft -r=multicraft`
